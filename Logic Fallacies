Though people may not identify logic Fallacies may not directly involved in their speaking, it has huge impact on clear communication. 
Several logic fallacies are identified in my speaking habits:
1. Answer the wrong question (答非所问)
2. Not direct irrelevant (谈不下去，不直接相关)
3. Talk about general stuff, not specific to the questions
4. Use my own experience/assumptions to interpret others' speaking（喜欢自己assume，用自己的assumption）
